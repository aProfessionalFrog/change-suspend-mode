# change-suspend-mode
A quick solution for toggling the suspend modes in Ubuntu.
It might work in other distros. I haven't tested it.

# Installation
Download the `suspendmode` file and put it in `/user/bin`. Make sure you make it executable by running `sudo chmod +x suspendmode`.

# Usage
Run `sudo suspendmode`
